One is a managed server, which housed the domain and the ftp service from cPanel. The other is a Virtual Private Server, which I deployed my node services with PM2 and ran the MongoDB instance. In addition to server, I had a mobile app which would be used on the field to collect offline submissions with GPS data included, this was made with the React Native framework.</p><br><p>All the services deployed on the VPS are REST services and the sites on the managed server are made with React.
